    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated: </strong> 12/03/2025</p>

    <h2>Camera Permission Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses camera permission ("android.permission.CAMERA") exclusively
      to allow the user to update their personal avatar. Camera usage is not
      mandatory, as the user has the option to select an existing photo from the
      device gallery.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage of Selected Image</h2>
    <p>
      Only the image captured or selected from the gallery by the user will be
      stored locally on the user's device and used as an avatar within the
      application. The app does not store or send these images to any external
      server nor share them with third parties without explicit user consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to the privacy and security of our users. As the avatar
      image is stored only locally on the user's device, there is no external
      storage or privacy risks associated with this permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may be updated at any time, so we recommend reviewing it
      regularly to be aware of the latest updates.
